In this paper, we present a growth model for special Cosserat rods that allows for induced rotation of cross-sections. The growth law considers two controls, one for lengthwise growth and another for rotations. This is explored in greater detail for straight rods with helical and hemitropic material symmetries by introduction of symmetry-preserving growth to account for the microstructure. The example of a guided-guided rod possessing a chiral microstructure is considered to study its deformation due to growth. We show the occurrence of growth-induced out-of-plane buckling in such rods.
