We study the inflation of a weakly magnetizable isotropic incompressible circular membrane in the presence of magnetic field generated by a magnetic dipole. We start with a variational formulation, solving the resulting governing equations to determine the equilibria and checking the second variation condition for stability. Conjecture of possibility of multiple equilibria under a single coupled load, and attaining elastic and magnetic limit points made in the above two papers is confirmed in the present work for a circular membrane. Another main focus of this work is on the determination of wrinkling instability in the membrane due to magnetoelastic stresses. Wrinkles along one or both in-plane directions of membrane appear in a majority of loading scenarios due to compressive Maxwell stresses. Our computations demonstrate that wrinkles arise in the central region when dipole and inflation are in the same direction and in the annular region close to the edges when the dipole and inflation are in opposite directions.
