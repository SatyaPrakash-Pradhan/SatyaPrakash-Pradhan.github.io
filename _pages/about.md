I am a graduate student in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Georgia Tech, pursuing my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Prof. Arash Yavari](https://research.gatech.edu/arash-yavari).


My Research
-----
My current research focuses on the mathematical modeling of accretion-ablation processes in deformable bodies. In particular, I'm studying the evolution of thermal stresses in nonlinear elastic solid bodies during the addition and removal of material points from the boundary via phase transition.

Before this, I studied instabilities in slender structures resulting from large deformations caused by multiphysics phenomena. My master's and undergraduate research focused on elastoelastic shells and magnetoelastic membranes. Additionally, I delved into the study of chiral material symmetries in rods and growth-induced instabilities in such structures.

My Interests
-----
My broad research interests lie in the mathematical modeling of physical problems, with a strong focus on Continuum Mechanics, Nonlinear Elasticity, and Structural Stability. Overall, my work employs tools such as Differential Geometry and the Calculus of Variations to study large deformations in various mechanical systems. 

My Background
------
I was born and raised in Bhubaneswar, India. I earned my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from IIT Hyderabad. Subsequently, I completed a Master's in Mechanics and Design at the same institute before moving to Atlanta for my Ph.D.
