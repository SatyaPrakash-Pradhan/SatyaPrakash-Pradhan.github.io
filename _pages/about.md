I am pursuing my Ph.D. in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

My Background
------
I was born and raised in Bhubaneswar, India. I earned a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from IIT Hyderabad. During the pandemic, I extended my program to complete a Master's in Mechanics and Design from the same institute.
