I am pursuing my Ph.D. in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Georgia Tech.

My Background
------
I was born and raised in Bhubaneswar, India. I earned my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from IIT Hyderabad. Subsequently, I completed a Master's in Mechanics and Design at the same institute before moving to Atlanta for my Ph.D.

My Research
-----
My current research focuses on the accretion and ablation of deformable bodies induced by phase transition. Together with my advisor, [Prof. Arash Yavari](https://research.gatech.edu/arash-yavari), I utilize a geometric theory developed within the group to understand the mechanics of such systems, which are governed by boundary value problems over an evolving domain, the location of whose boundary is a priori unknown.




My Interests
