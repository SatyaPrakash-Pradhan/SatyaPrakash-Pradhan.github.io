I am a graduate student in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Georgia Tech, pursuing my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Prof. Arash Yavari](https://research.gatech.edu/arash-yavari).


My Research
-----
My current research focuses on the mathematical modeling of accretion-ablation processes in deformable bodies. In particular, I'm studying the evolution of thermal stresses in nonlinear elastic solid bodies during the addition and removal of material points from the boundary via phase transition.

My Interests
-----
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. 

My Background
------
I was born and raised in Bhubaneswar, India. I earned my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from IIT Hyderabad. Subsequently, I completed a Master's in Mechanics and Design at the same institute before moving to Atlanta for my Ph.D.
